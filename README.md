### Key Features
* Settable RPD (rotations per day) between 100 - 960rpd
* Single direction (clockwise / anti-clockwise) or bi-directional winding.
* Settable start time. Have it wind while you're asleep, or while you're away, or anytime for that matter. Manual start / stop is also available, of course.
* 3 seconds of rest after 3 minutes of rotation, in every mode.
* Estimated cycle duration (how long it'll take to wind your watch).
* Cycle progress display (how far along the current winding routine is).
* Software or optional physical button to trigger ON/OFF state, so you can disable it completely.
* Simple setup. Flash the firmware with a few clicks, then connect your phone (or other device) to the winder's setup wifi network & add it to your home network.
* Modular means that a single powered unit can drive N number of passive winders.
* There's no app required! You control it from a web browser. 
* Silent belt drive
* Minimal electronics / programming experience required
* Easy to print!
