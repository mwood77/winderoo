> The following tables contains affiliate links to Aliexpress; you do not pay an inflated price because of this. Should you decide to use another supplier, please ensure that you cross-reference this table and buy identical components.

> While most of these components are standardized, I will not be able to assist you if you purchase your components from a separate supplier, as the winder was designed around the components (as supplied) beneath.

### Optional parts
The following parts list will allow you to add:
- 1x SSD1306 compatible OLED screen (0.96" size)
- 1x MX1508 Motor Controller. This is a much smaller DC motor controller. Winderoo supports granular motor control with this board (PWM control); you must set a build flag to use this, which has a callout step during the [software installation instructions](./install-software.md).
