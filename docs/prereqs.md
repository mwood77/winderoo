## Download and install the following:
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
    - Note: the "extensions" button has changed since Platformio has created their install guide. You can access the extions pane with the following key combinations:
        - Windows: Ctrl+Shift+X
        - macOS: Command+Shift+X
1. You may or may not need these drivers, but some 'knock off' ESP32 dev boards require them.
    - [CP210x Drivers](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) 
    - If the CP210x drivers don't work:  [CH340 Drivers](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers) 

You may now proceed to either of these next steps: ***Software Installation*** or ***Build Guide***
